Create a script to download transaction data from the UP Bank API between two dates of a financial year.

Requirements:
1. Read authentication token from a .env file along with start and end date
3. Process one month at a time to handle large data sets
4. Add a delay to avoid rate limiting.
5. Handle pagination (100 transactions per page)
6. Save each month's transactions to a separate JSON file
7. Combine multiple pages into single files

API Details:
- Base URL: https://api.up.com.au/api/v1/transactions
- Authentication: Bearer token in Authorization header
- Query parameters:
  - page[size]: 100
  - filter[since]: Start date in ISO format (2023-07-01T00:00:00Z)
  - filter[until]: End date in ISO format  
- Pagination: Follow the "links.next" field in the response until null

Output:
- Single JSON file per month: transactions_YYYY-MM-DD_complete.json
- Each file should combine all pages for that month (use jq because we may use it for more processing later)
- Preserve original API response structure (data, links, meta)

Note:
- Support macOS date command
- Provide progress feedback. Don't make curl silent. See everything.
